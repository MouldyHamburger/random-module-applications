# random-module-application
Four "games" created using the "random" module in python, coin flip, dice roll, double dice roll, and rock paper scissors.

- unlike past applications, there is now error handling if 'audio.mp3' is missing from the application directory

- all four applications were built on the dice roll applications source code but modified to function in different ways
